# 🧩 Flutter: `Flexible` vs `Expanded`

Both `Flexible` and `Expanded` are used in `Row`, `Column`, or `Flex` widgets to manage how children share space. But they behave differently!

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Feature                     | `Flexible`                                               | `Expanded`                                             |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Takes all available space? | ❌ Only if needed (respects child size)                   | ✅ Yes — fills all remaining space                      |
| Can shrink to fit child?   | ✅ Yes                                                    | ❌ No — child must expand to fill space                |
| Requires a child?          | ✅ Yes                                                    | ✅ Yes                                                  |
| Uses `flex` ratio?         | ✅ Yes                                                    | ✅ Yes                                                  |

## 🧠 Mental Model

- `Expanded` → “**Take all remaining space**!”
- `Flexible` → “**I'll grow if I have to, but I’d rather stay small.**”

## 💡 Example Code

```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Flexible(
      child: Container(width: 100, height: 50, color: Colors.red),
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(height: 50, color: Colors.green),
    ),
    Flexible(
      child: Container(width: 100, height: 50, color: Colors.blue),
    ),
  ],
);
```
### I have another things
In the flexible you will give him a specific width and height , he will keep on using them , but when getting less ,
the flexible will adapt and try to be good with the new width and height , unlike the expanded ,
and the flexible will always take the space of its content , but when reached it limit , it will stop
