#### Stack
it can create multiple elements above each other , and inside it you can use the Positioned inside it 
#### Regarding the Cubit
I tried to use the Either data type , but i have some problems during cubit , i need to work again on this part
#### What is the difference between SingleScrollView and ListView
ListView -> Can have many children , you can decide the axis of scrolling , renders only visible elements Lazy reload 
ofc , you can't do all of this in the SingleScrollView
