## Welcome again to another file of useless repo
Just to tell you fast , if you want to remove the ripple effect from any widget like inkwell,
you need to wrap them inside of Theme widget , you have to know that Theme is actually giving the main Theme of the app , so the widget,
So you just need to add to the theme data that you want the splashColor and highlightColor to be zero so that they will work
